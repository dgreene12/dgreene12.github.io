                <p>I'm a senior at Duke University from Richmond, Virginia, studying public policy with minors in education and inequality studies. As a researcher and data analyst for the Southeast Regional Coalition for University-Assisted Community Schools and Durham University-Assisted Community Schools Research Collective, I led the creation and growth of a dashboard showcasing resources for Durham schools for three years, supported successful private and federal grant proposals, and oversaw various other technical projects. I've presented this research to a wide array of stakeholders, including administrators, educators, parents, community leaders, and academics, through more than 15 presentations throughout North Carolina, the East Coast, and the rest of the country.</p>

                <p>My engagement in higher education policy, instruction, and university-K-12 partnerships extends across local and national spheres. I hold multiple positions across Duke’s campus, including in the Graduate School, Sanford School of Public Policy, Trinity College of Arts and Sciences, and Office of Government and State Relations. I also serve on the Board of Trustees Racial Equity Advisory Council, Board of Trustees Undergraduate Education Committee, Board of Trustees Strategic Engagement Program, and Office of University Scholars and Fellows’ Excellence, Diversity, Inclusion, and Equity Committee. Other recent roles include chairing Duke's International Orientation for three years, teaching middle school math in Holly Springs, Mississippi, and analyzing data for AccessLex Institute, a Pennsylvania-based education nonprofit.</p>
