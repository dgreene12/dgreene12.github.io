        <p>I'm a senior at Duke University from Richmond, Virginia, studying public policy with minors in education and inequality studies. As a researcher and data analyst for the <a href="http://sites.duke.edu/uacs" target="_blank">Durham University-Assisted Community Schools Research Collective</a>, I've led the creation and growth of a dashboard showcasing resources for Durham schools for three years. I've presented this research to a wide array of stakeholders, including administrators, educators, parents, community leaders, and academics, through more than 10 presentations at various forums throughout Durham and across the country.</p>
        <p>My engagement in higher education policy, instruction, and university-K-12 partnerships extends across local and national spheres. I hold multiple positions across Duke’s campus, including in the Graduate School, Sanford School of Public Policy, Trinity College of Arts and Sciences, and Office of Government and State Relations. I also serve on the <a href="https://racialequity.duke.edu/reac/subcommittees/communication/" target="_blank">Board of Trustees Racial Equity Advisory Council</a>, <a href="https://trustees.duke.edu/committees/undergraduate-education-committee/" target="_blank">Board of Trustees Undergraduate Education Committee</a>, Board of Trustees Strategic Engagement Program, and Office of University Scholars and Fellows’ Excellence, Diversity, Inclusion, and Equity Committee. Other recent roles include chairing Duke's International Orientation for three years, teaching middle school math in Holly Springs, Mississippi, and analyzing data for AccessLex Institute, a Pennsylvania-based education nonprofit.</p>
        <p>I'm a <a href="https://ousf.duke.edu/profile/drew-greene/" target="_blank">Reginaldo Howard Memorial Scholar</a> and Duke’s recipient of the 2023 Community Impact Student Award awarded by NC Campus Engagement. In my spare time, I coach 5-6-year-old basketball in the Durham Parks and Recreation league through <a href="https://www.coachtoinspire.org/" target="_blank">Coach2Inspire</a>, a local nonprofit.</p>
